Dear Brair,

Hope this letter finds you well. 
You may wonder why I suddenly start to send you letters like this. Well—-  
Today I met your mom in front of the supermarket. Years passed yet I feel she is still the same as before, how lovely.  
You should already know this because I sent you pictures immediately, and you replied you also heard from your parents.   
It was a sunny day.  

Your mom said “The sun owns the day” and “ in the middle of our small talk, and I thought about you. You talked like this when we were in mid school, and I wasn't even surprised you became a poet.  
It just makes me miss the days we spent hours and hours talking to each other after school and on weekends. I typed this sentence in the chat but didn’t send it to you. Forgive me, I was just feeling embarrassed to say it directly.  

I was wondering if we could do something to restore…our bond?? I am kinda freed from academic projects recently and we might dig into funny stuff. I don’t even know what I am expecting.  

Fingers crossed that the post office would deliver this letter to you. If they lost it it's also fine though.  

Yours,  
Ash
